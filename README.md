# SuperGiantGames Mod Format
Format for making and loading lua mods for most of SuperGiantGames' games (Transistor, Pyre, Hades)

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/MagicGonads/ssg-mod-format/wiki) for the important information!

To use `importmods.py` put it in the game's Content folder.     
When run with python it will add imports to the scripts from the mods in the `Content/Mods` folder to the appropriate place in the base files.
