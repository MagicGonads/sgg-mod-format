# SuperGiantGames Mod Format
Format for making and loading lua mods for most of SuperGiantGames' games (Transistor, Pyre, Hades)

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/MagicGonads/ssg-mod-format/wiki) for the important information!

To use `modimporter.py` put it in the game's Content folder.     
When run with python it will read the mods in the folders in `Content/Mods` and implement the changes to the base files.
Check 'Content/Backups' for the base files prior to importing.
